# MOTOR-WORLD-KENYA
## Project Description 
This front-end app is connected to a backend online car showroom rails API, which has four resources namely: cars, users, showroom, and reviews. 

## Project SetUp
To use this project, just click on the provided deployment link. Alternatively, you can clone it to your local environment, navigate to the project folder, run the cmd `nmp install` and then finally `npm start` while on your terminal. Please note, you may need to clone the backend api using this link `https://github.com/DKarimi90/motor-world-kenya` as the backend is not currently deployed. Navigate to the project folder, and run `bundle install`, `rails db:migrate db:seed` and finally `rails s` to start the backend server. With all this done, the project should be running. 

## Functionalities 
Some of the app functionalities include the ability to sign up, login, post a car, search for a car, navigate to the purchase section, delete a car and other public routes. 

## Project Status
This is still work in progress. Looking forward to improving the project by integrating more features.
